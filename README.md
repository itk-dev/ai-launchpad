# AI Launchpad

This project provides a website for sharing information and documentation about Large Language Modules (LLM). It also
provides a setup for running LLMs locally in [Ollama](https://github.com/ollama/ollama) docker container too allow
testing of modules in a GDPR safe environment.

It is built around PHP 8.3 and Drupal based on docker containers.

__Note__: this project also provides plugins to allow integration with OpenAI API and Azure AI API. This is done through
Drupal's plugin API, which allow other to build new modules that provides connections to other LLM APIs.

For more information about this integration, look at the custom module
[https://github.com/itk-dev/llm_services](https://github.com/itk-dev/llm_services) which provides the default plugins.

## Local development

This project contains a docker compose setup build around [https://github.com/itk-dev/devops_itkdev-docker](https://github.com/itk-dev/devops_itkdev-docker)
which is a simple wrapper script around docker compose using [traefik](https://traefik.io/traefik/) as a revers proxy
to get FQDN to access the site.

If you do not want to use this wrapper, you can substitute the `itkdev-docer-compose` command with normal
`docker compose` remembering to load the right composer file using the `-f <file>` option.

This setup also assumes that you have a docker network shared with treafik, if you are not using the wrapper, use this
command to create the network first.

```shell
docker network create --driver=bridge --attachable --internal=false frontend
```

### Site installation

Run the following commands to set up the site. This will run a normal Drupal site installation with the existing
configuration that comes with this project.

```shell
itkdev-docker-compose up -d
itkdev-docker-compose composer install
itkdev-docker-compose drush site-install minimal --existing-config -y
```

When the installation is completed, that admin user is created and the password for logging in the outputted. If you
forget the password, use drush uli command to get a one-time-login link (not the uri here only works if you are using
trafik).

```shell
itkdev-docker-compose drush uli --uri="https://launchpad.local.itkdev.dk/"
```

### Access the site

If you are using out `itkdev-docker-compose` simple use the command below to Ã¥bne the site in you default browser.

```shell
itkdev-docker-compose open
```

Alternatively you can find the port number that is mapped nginx container that server the site at `http://0.0.0.0:PORT`
by using this command:

```shell
docker compose port nginx 8080
```

### Drupal config

This project uses Drupal's configuration import and export to handle configuration changes and uses the
[config ignore](https://www.drupal.org/project/config_ignore) module to protect some of the site settings form being
overridden. For local and production configuration settings that you do not want to export, please use
`settings.local.php` to override default configuration values.

Export config created from drupal:

```shell
itkdev-docker-compose drush config:export
```

Import config from config files:

```shell
itkdev-docker-compose drush config:export
```
